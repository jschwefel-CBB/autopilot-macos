# Run the unified capability plan via the autopilot CLI against the built
# TestHostApp fixture, exactly as an end user would. This is the macOS analogue
# of the iOS XCUITest / Android instrumented run: it exercises the full 78-step
# plan end-to-end and FAILS (non-zero) if any step fails.
#
# Targets the fixture BY ABSOLUTE PATH (not bundleId) so it is deterministic and
# never resolves a same-bundle-id app from elsewhere on the machine.
#
# Requires: Accessibility + Screen Recording permission for the process running
# this (locally: grant your terminal; in CI the runner grants them). Build the
# CLI (`swift build`) and the fixture (`Fixtures/TestHostApp/make-app.sh`) first,
# or pass --build to have this script do both.
